Kongregate Userscripts
======================

A collection of the Kongregate userscripts I've written in the past few years.
Most of these scripts are probably broken by now, so use at your own risk.

Most of these scripts are hosted on [my userscripts.org profile][uso]
as well, so it's probably best to download them from there. For a more detailed
description of the scripts and how to use them, see their respective page on userscripts.org
